# Covid Data Project

This repository contains SQL scripts used to query and analyze global COVID-19 data on deaths and vaccinations from December 2019 to April 2021. The project focused on extracting meaningful insights from COVID-19 data, which were visualized in an interactive Tableau Public dashboard.

## Key Features

### Data Preparation
Queried and processed partial datasets using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to analyze COVID-19 trends globally and by location.

### Queries and Insights
- Calculated infection and death rates as percentages of population and total cases.
- Identified peak infection rates, death counts, and vaccination rollouts by country.
- Compared global and continental statistics, including cumulative trends.
- Joined data from multiple tables to combine vaccination and case information.

### SQL Techniques
- **SELECT** statement
- **WHERE** clause and logical conditions
- **GROUP BY** and aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, MAX)
- **JOINS**
- **Window function**
- **Subquery**
- **Common Table Expression** (CTE)
- **Temporary table** and **View**


### Visualization
The processed data was visualized using Tableau Public, resulting in an interactive dashboard that highlights key insights and trends. View the dashboard <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ramit.c5222/viz/CovidDashboard_17363553630350/Dashboard1">here.</a>
